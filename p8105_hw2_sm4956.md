## Problem 0

-   created repository and R project for HW2, created rmd file and
    rending to GitHub.
-   created a sub-directory/ data folder that has all the data set files
    to be used for this HW

``` r
library(tidyverse)
```

options(tibble.print_min = 5)
```

## Problem 1

reading and cleaning data, retaining important variables

``` r
trans_ent = 
  read_csv(
    "data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv",
    col_types = cols(Route8 = "c", Route9 = "c", Route10 = "c", Route11 = "c")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(
    line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, 
    starts_with("route"), entry, exit_only, vending, entrance_type, 
    ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE))
```

To check the number of distinct stations:

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##   station_name line    
    ##   <chr>        <chr>   
    ## 1 25th St      4 Avenue
    ## 2 36th St      4 Avenue
    ## 3 45th St      4 Avenue
    ## 4 53rd St      4 Avenue
    ## 5 59th St      4 Avenue
    ## # … with 460 more rows

To check the number of distinct stations that are ADA Compliant:

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##   station_name             line           
    ##   <chr>                    <chr>          
    ## 1 Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr 4 Avenue       
    ## 2 DeKalb Av                4 Avenue       
    ## 3 Pacific St               4 Avenue       
    ## 4 Grand Central            42nd St Shuttle
    ## 5 34th St                  6 Avenue       
    ## # … with 79 more rows

To see the proportion of station entrances/exits without vending allow
entrance:

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  pull(entry) %>% 
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

To check the distinct stations serving A trains (and the ones that are
ADA Compliant):

``` r
trans_ent %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 60 × 2
    ##   station_name                  line           
    ##   <chr>                         <chr>

    ## 5 168th St - Washington Heights 8 Avenue       
    ## # … with 55 more rows

``` r

    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>% 
  filter(route == "A", ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(station_name, line) %>% 
  distinct
```

### Answers

-   There are 465 distinct stations.
-   There are 84 distinct stations, that are ADA compliant.
-   the proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance is 0.38.
-   There are 60 distinct stations, that serve the A train.
-   There are 17 distinct stations, that serve the A train and are ADA
    compliant.

## Problem 2

Reading and cleaning the data set for Mr Trash Wheel

``` r
trash_W1 = 
  readxl::read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N549") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na (dumpster) %>%
mutate (
        sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls),
        wheel = "mrtrash")
```

Now, I will repeat the same for Professor Trash Wheel

``` r
prof_W2 = 
  read_excel("data/Trash Wheel Collection Data.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:M96") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na (dumpster) %>%
mutate (year = as.character(year),
       wheel = "proftrash" )
```

Combining both the data sets:

``` r
merged_trash = bind_rows (trash_W1, prof_W2) %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
```

    data set is **1947, 2015** this dataset has key variables **year,
    month, gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem,
    president, close, unemployment\_%** that describe: year, date,
    president (whether the president was republican or democratic),
    gov_gop (no. of republican governors), sen_gop (no. of republican
    senators), rep_gop(no. of republican reps), gov_dem (no. of
    democratic governors), sen_dem (no. of democratic senators), rep_dem
    (no. of democratic reps): all of these with their associated time;
    close (the closing values of stock index with associated dates) and
    unemployment% (percentage of unemployment at that time).

-   summary of pomo_snp: the merged data set has **822** observations
    and **10** variables. the range of the years in this data set is
    **1947, 2015** this dataset has key variables **year, month,
    gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president,
    close**

-   summary of pols_ds: this dataset describes the number of national
    politicians who were either democratic or republic at a given time
    (month and year). The previous dataset pols-month.csv had 822
    observations and 9 variables. it had separate columns for democratic
    and republican presidents and date. The pols_ds has **822**
    observations and **9** variables. the range of the years in this
    data set is **1947, 2015**. The key variables are **year, month,
    gov_gop, sen_gop, rep_gop, gov_dem, sen_dem, rep_dem, president**.
    This cleaned dataset pols_ds has a single column for president to
    see whether they were democratic or republican, and the mon (date)
    was broken down to separate columns for day, month, and year- of
    which day column was removed.

-   summary of snp_ds: this dataset describes the closing values of S&P
    stock index at a given time (month and year). The previous snp
    dataset had 787 observations and 2 variables. This dataset had date
    and closing values of stock index. The snp_ds has **787**
    observations and **3** variables. the range of the years in this
    data set is **1950, 2015**. The key variables are **year, month,
    close** This cleaned dataset snp_ds has a columnn for closing
    values, and the date column was broken down to separate columns for
    day, month, and year- of which day column was removed. The format
    for year was also converted to 4 digit from the 2-digit format.

-   summary of unemploy_ds: this dataset describes the percentage of
    unemployment at a given time (month and year). The previous
    unemployment dataset has 68 observations and 13 variables. It had
    unemployment % distributed by each month and year. The unemploy_ds
    has **816** observations and **3** variables. the range of the years
    in this data set is **1948, 2015**. The key variables are **year,
    month, unemployment\_%**. This cleaned dataset unemploy_ds has
    unemployment % column and 2 other columns for showing unemployment
    by month and year.
